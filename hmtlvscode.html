        <h3>Customer service based role</h3>
        <p>During my studies I've decided it would be beneficial to start earning money on the side of education by
            working a part-time job. Working in a customer based envirnment has made me develop great communications skills aswell
            as well being able to demonstrate teamwork amongs the other staff. The work has also enabled me to improve my problem
            solving skills and has taught me how to become adaptive.
